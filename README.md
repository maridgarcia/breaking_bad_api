# Welcome to The Breaking Bad Vehicles API!

### I started working on this API when I was a little bored and wanted to have fun while coding. So I mixed the things I like the most: being in front of a computer screen, reading about cars and one of my favorite TV shows.

### Currently, the API has only one endpoint that retrieves the information on the car, its owner  and a brief description of the car along with its relationship to the owner. Access the endpoint using this link: <strong>https://breakingbadcars.cyclic.app/</strong>.
